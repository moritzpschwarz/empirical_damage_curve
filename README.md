Replication Repository for Schwarz and Pretis: An empirical climate damage function accounting for climate extremes and adaptation

## Abstract
Quantifying the economic impacts of climate change is crucial to inform mitigation and adaptation policy. Allowing for the potential impact of climate extremes and plausible adaptation pathways, we estimate a climate damage function using machine learning and econometric model selection. Combined with a novel baseline of country-level long-run forecasts of future economic development, we project a decline in median GDP per capita of around 23% for 1.5°C warming, with median reductions of up to 66% for warming beyond 4.5°C relative to no climate change. Projected marginal impacts suggest an approximate 12% decline in median GDP per capita for each additional degree of warming. We provide empirical evidence of climate adaptation at a macro-economic level, showing that the damage curve has not remained constant over time or incomes. Instability over time has lowered projected median GDP per capita impacts by approximately 20 percentage points. Income-driven adaptation could reduce the marginal impacts of an additional degree of warming by a half. Nevertheless, projected damages remain high and unequal even in the presence of adaptation, suggesting median GDP per capita reductions of around 30-40% for warming beyond 4.5°C, reiterating the urgent case for stringent mitigation policy.
